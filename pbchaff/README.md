## PBCHAFF SAT Solver

PBCHAFF is a satisfiability engine that is based on the chaff algorithm. It has been adapted to use pseudo-Boolean constraints and learning. It also allows modulo two constraints.

The PBCHAFF code depends on the larger satlib repository that contains it. The easiest way to build it is to checkout the larger library and build the whole thing.
